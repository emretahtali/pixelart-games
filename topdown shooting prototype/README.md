this is a topdown shooting game prototype i've made in 2018 when i was new to game developing.

it's made in GameMaker Studio 2.

since i'd been plannig this to be a rouge-like game, there is a map on the top-left corner that is randomised on every restart.

there is only one room in this protototype. in it, there is one idle enemy, and one patrolling enemy.

the player can sneak the enemies from behind.

if an enemy sees the player, they will chase the player to the last position they've seen him, wait for a bit, and return to their duty.
